🔹 **Statistical Analysis** – Applied methods like **trend analysis and correlation studies** to assess treatment effectiveness.  
🔹 **Healthcare Operations Expertise** – Used **real-world hospital data** to derive actionable recommendations.  

## **Dataset**  
The project analyzes **two Excel datasets** covering **hospital and patient data**:  

### **1️⃣ Patient Information**  
- **Patient ID** – Unique identifier  
- **Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type** – Demographic details  
- **Diagnosis & Treatment** – Medical condition and administered treatment  
- **Admission & Discharge Date** – Patient timeline  
- **Total Bill** – Total cost of hospitalization  
- **Full Prescription Details** – Medication history  

### **2️⃣ Hospital & Staff Information**  
- **Hospital Name & Room Number** – Patient’s assigned facility and room  
- **Doctor Name** – Attending physician  
- **Daily Cost** – Per-day cost of hospital stay  
- **Treatment & Recovery Rating** – Treatment type and patient’s post-care recovery score  

## **Business Problem**  
🔹 **"How can hospitals reduce treatment costs while maintaining or improving patient recovery outcomes?"**  

By analyzing **treatment costs, patient demographics, and recovery trends**, this project provides **data-driven recommendations** for optimizing healthcare services.  

## **Key Insights & Recommendations**  

### **1️⃣ Cost vs. Recovery Ratings**  
**Insight:**  
- **Surgery incurs the highest costs but does not always yield the best recovery results.**  
- **Counseling and physical therapy show high recovery ratings at significantly lower costs.**  

**Recommendation:**  
✅ Shift focus towards **cost-effective treatments** like counseling and therapy where applicable.  

### **2️⃣ Age-Specific Recovery Trends**  
**Insight:**  
- **Seniors exhibit the most variability in recovery ratings, suggesting different treatment needs.**  

**Recommendation:**  
✅ Implement **age-targeted treatment protocols** based on **historical recovery trends**.  

### **3️⃣ Seasonal Patient Admissions**  
**Insight:**  
- **Hospital admissions spike in certain months for specific diagnoses.**  

**Recommendation:**  
✅ Adjust **staffing, bed availability, and inventory management** to accommodate peak admission seasons.  

### **4️⃣ Alternative to Surgery**  
**Insight:**  
- **Many conditions currently treated with surgery could be managed with lower-cost alternatives.**  

**Recommendation:**  
✅ Pilot **non-surgical interventions**, such as **medication-based treatments or therapy**, and compare outcomes.  

## **Stakeholder Action Plan**
